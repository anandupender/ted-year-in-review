# TED Year in Review

### Summary
A “Year in Review” microsite experience to celebrate the diversity of ideas shared across TED. The core thesis is that piggybacking on a cultural milestone like New Years can create meaning and connection amongst our audience - turning strangers into fans and talk viewers into volunteers. This models is already being used as a marketing tool in many companies from NYT and Spotify to Pocket and Google. There’s even a whole site dedicated to cataloging year in review sites! TED is uniquely positioned, with its content and communities, to make a big splash with a Year in Review site of its own.
